                Efficient energy utilization in thermal systems has become an increasingly critical focus in recent years, particularly in domestic and commercial kitchen environments. Traditional heating systems, although simple in design, frequently exhibit significant energy inefficiencies due to outdated technologies, inadequate insulation, and suboptimal system integration. These shortcomings contribute to unnecessary energy wastage and increased operational costs. This has driven a growing demand for innovative, energy-efficient heating solutions, with advanced thermal technologies such as heat pumps gaining attention as promising alternatives. Heat pumps, with their ability to deliver substantial energy savings and reduce environmental impact, present a compelling opportunity to revolutionize modern kitchen heating systems.
