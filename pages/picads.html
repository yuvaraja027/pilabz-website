            <p class="productDesc">
                Pi-CADS – Motor is a next-generation SaaS-based cloud platform designed for rapid 2D axisymmetric motor design, analysis, and optimization. Tailored for motor designers, engineers, enthusiasts, and manufacturers in India and globally, it supports the creation of custom electric vehicle (EV) and non-EV motors for various applications, including appliances and machinery, with integrated modules for vehicle dynamics, motor design, and performance analysis.
                <br><br>
                 For EV applications, users can determine motor specifications using the built-in Vehicle Dynamics module, and design motors based on one of three topologies:
                <br><br>
                IPMSM (Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor)
                <br>
                SPMSM (Surface Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor)
                <br> SynRM (Synchronous Reluctance Motor)
                <br><br>
                For non-EV applications, users can design motors by inputting required torque, speed (peak and continuous), or defining motor geometry based on specific use cases.

            <h1 class="productTitle">Why Pi-CADS – Motor?</h1>
            <h2 style="color: green; margin-bottom: 2px;">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="productDesc">Most commercial motor design tools begin with fixed stator and rotor geometries wherein users would first need to enter the dimensions of Stator and Rotor, forcing engineers into lengthy, trial-and-error simulation cycles. Creating complex slot and hole designs is often tedious, time-consuming, and expensive.</p>
            <h2 style="color: green; margin-bottom: 2px;">Solutions</h2>
            <p class="productDesc">
                <span class="productSubTitle">Effortless Geometry Creation</span>
