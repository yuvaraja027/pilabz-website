            <p class="productDesc">
                Pi-CADS – Motor is a cloud-based 2D axisymmetric motor design and simulation platform tailored for both the EV industry and broader applications across appliances and machinery. It enables rapid motor design, analysis, and optimization for manufacturers seeking performance and efficiency.
                <br><br>
                Pi-CADS – Motor is a next-generation SaaS-based cloud platform tailored for motor designers, engineers, enthusiasts, and manufacturers across India and global markets. It supports the creation of custom electric vehicle (EV) and non-EV motors with integrated modules for vehicle dynamics, motor design, and performance analysis. For EV applications, users can determine motor specifications using the built-in Vehicle Dynamics module, and design motors based on one of three topologies:
                <br><br>
                IPMSM (Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor)
                <br>
                SPMSM (Surface Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor)
                <br> SynRM (Synchronous Reluctance Motor)
                <br><br>
                For non-EV applications, users can design motors by inputting required torque, speed (peak and continuous), or defining motor geometry based on specific use cases.
